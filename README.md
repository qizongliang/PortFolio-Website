# PortFolio-Website


This is my first portfolio-website. Since I'M not a good web developer. I implemented a solution provided by a youtuber that goes by the name of 
Bedimcode (https://youtu.be/oy8dSsK57Ps). Anyway It was a fun testing experience and I hope not everyone is mad over me taking someone else's solution.
My Old solution was also contained in the directory Old. It was a half decent solution but it does get the job done. Anyway. I skip over some parts of the
youtuber's solution and added some of my own touch to the information. Nothing much is done other than the about home image which is modified to suit 
my image. Thank you and have a nice day.
